# --- Basic Setup ---
# Run vsftpd in standalone mode
listen=YES
# Listen on all IPv4 addresses on the specified port
listen_address=0.0.0.0
listen_port=21
# Custom banner
ftpd_banner=Welcome to the Inception FTP server!

# --- User Authentication and Access ---
# Disallow anonymous FTP
anonymous_enable=NO
# Allow local users (defined in /etc/passwd) to log in
local_enable=YES
# Enable FTP write commands (UPLOAD, DELETE, MKDIR, etc.)
write_enable=YES
# Default umask for files created by local users (022 means owner=rw, group=r, other=r)
local_umask=022

# --- Chroot Configuration ---
# Restrict local users to their home directory.
# The home directory for 'www-data' is set to /var/www/html in the Dockerfile/entrypoint.
chroot_local_user=YES
# Allow the chroot directory to be writable.
# This is necessary because /var/www/html (the home dir) needs to be writable by www-data.
allow_writeable_chroot=YES

# --- User List Configuration ---
# Enable userlist functionality
userlist_enable=YES
# Specify the userlist file (created by your entrypoint script)
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.userlist
# When userlist_deny=NO, the userlist_file acts as an ALLOW list.
# Only users in this file can log in.
userlist_deny=NO

# --- Passive Mode FTP ---
# Enable passive mode (essential for NAT/firewall traversal)
pasv_enable=YES
# Specify a range of ports for passive mode data connections.
# Ensure these ports are exposed in your Dockerfile and mapped in docker-compose.yml.
pasv_min_port=21000
pasv_max_port=21010
# If your Docker host has a specific external IP and you face issues, you might need:
# pasv_address=YOUR_DOCKER_HOST_EXTERNAL_IP
# pasv_addr_resolve=YES # If pasv_address is a hostname

# --- Logging ---
# Enable logging of uploads/downloads
xferlog_enable=YES
# Log in standard ftpd xferlog format (optional, but common)
xferlog_std_format=YES
# vsftpd will log to /var/log/xferlog or /var/log/vsftpd.log depending on xferlog_std_format

# --- Security & Performance ---
# Disable seccomp filter sandbox if it causes issues on your kernel/Alpine version.
seccomp_sandbox=NO
# Directory messages (largely cosmetic)
dirmessage_enable=YES
# Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data).
connect_from_port_20=YES
# Secure chroot directory (vsftpd needs a non-writable, root-owned empty directory)
secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty
